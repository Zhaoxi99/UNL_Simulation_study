“The Underlap Coefficient as Measure of a Biomarker’s Discriminatory
Ability in a Three-Class Disease Setting”
================
Zhaoxi Zhang, Vanda Inácio, and Miguel de Carvalho

In this tutorial we describe the steps for obtaining the results of the
simulation study in the unconditional case in Section 5 of the paper.

We consider both the uncondtional case and the covariate specific case in the paper. The tutorials of how to get the plots in Section 5 of the paper are in the "tutorials" folder of the repository. The functions needed for the simulation study are in the "functions" folder of the repository
